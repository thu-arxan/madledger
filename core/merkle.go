// BuildMerkleTreeStore creates a merkle tree from a slice of transactions,
// stores it using a linear array, and returns a slice of the backing array.  A
// linear array was chosen as opposed to an actual tree structure since it uses
// about half as much memory.  The following describes a merkle tree and how it
// is stored in a linear array.
//
// A merkle tree is a tree in which every non-leaf node is the hash of its
// children nodes.  A diagram depicting how this works for bitcoin transactions
// where h(x) is a double sha256 follows:
//
//	         root = h1234 = h(h12 + h34)
//	        /                           \
//	  h12 = h(h1 + h2)            h34 = h(h3 + h4)
//	   /            \              /            \
//	h1 = h(tx1)  h2 = h(tx2)    h3 = h(tx3)  h4 = h(tx4)
//
// The above stored as a linear array is as follows:
//
// 	[h1 h2 h3 h4 h12 h34 root]
//
// As the above shows, the merkle root is always the last element in the array.
//
// The number of inputs is not always a power of two which results in a
// balanced tree structure as above.  In that case, parent nodes with no
// children are also zero and parent nodes with only a single left node
// are calculated by concatenating the left node with itself before hashing.
// Since this function uses nodes that are pointers to the hashes, empty nodes
// will be nil.
// However, the Bitcoin ignores the situation of there is no transactions
// So return all zero when there is no transactions
